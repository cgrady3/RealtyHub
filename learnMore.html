            <h2>Welcome To RealtyHub!</h2>

            <p id="introLetter">
                The Realty Hub business model at its core is a digital brokerage firm. Instead of a firm located in a
                single area, Realty Hub is primarily online which will help the company expand out to different cities
                and even states to reach as many agents as possible to do business through technology without feeling
                restricted. With the idea of implementing a complete computerized realty, it provides faster
                communication between the business and its clients providing great customer service which is a key point
                needed in realty. One of the advantages of the Realty Hub being digital is that money is being saved
                that would originally be used on outdated processes. The digital brokerage allows the company to work
                with a leaner and agile model as opposed to a more complicated one with more infrastructure while still
                reaching into the market. Also promoting the realty brokerage through technological formats such as
                social media and a proposed website will introduce the brokerage to a larger audience compared to just,
                for example, renting a billboard in a local area. This allows the company to reach a wider audience
                across all social media platforms. As of now in the business model the client Mr. Louie reaches out to
                clients through Google ads and has been in business since 2018. He does not keep a physical workspace
                but a digital one to do business with his realty agent clients and he provides them with a great offer
                of taking a lower percentage of their commission rate than that of the average realty brokerage firm.
