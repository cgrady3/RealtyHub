            <h2>Welcome To RealtyHub!</h2>

            <p id="introLetter">
                With new advancements in technology, we were able to create a digital realty called RealtyHub. By doing
                this, we are allowing our real estate agents to operate without having to report to a central office. As
                a company, we will provide everything the real estate agent may need such as marketing resources, admin
                support, and even an increase in savings through reasonable splits and sharing profit. By implementing
                these key aspects, it will help the agent obtain a sense of mobility with larger shares in the
                commissions they received. Moreover, by utilizing online transaction tools agents can get closing deals
                done on the go from anywhere in the world contingent upon internet connection. A couple of popular
                online transaction tools our client Mr. Louie could use to accomplish these business transactions would
                be the Dotloop and SkySlope software that allows a broker and their agent to edit and share documents
                with each other as well as complete real estate transactions digitally. With the help of electronic
                transactions, this allows payments to be collected instantly 24/7 avoiding processing delays and the
                risk of losing a check in the mail. This also helps our clients, and us, by eliminating the hassle of
                having to travel to the post office/bank and spending money on stamps, envelopes, ink and other
                materials that is required to writing and processing checks.
