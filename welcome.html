            <h1>Welcome To RealtyHub!</h1>

            <p>I'd be a great asset to your team and here's why! (Hire me).</p>

            <p>I'm currently a student at the University of Central Florida, enrolled in their Computer Science
                Engineering
                program. I've recently graduated the Trilogy Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.</p>

            <p>All this means I have experience creating web applications, start to finish, and front to back. I have
                experience with C, Java, JavaScript (vanilla and with jquery), HTML, EJS, CSS, and Bootstrap. Databases
                I've
                used in web projects include: Firebase, MySQL, MongoDB, and Heroku. I've utilzed API's and AJAX, having
                designed
                my own and utilizing the API's of others. Node.js and NPMs, such as Express, Bcrypt, Passport,
                Handlebars,
                Axios, and Cheerio.</p>

            <p>Me personally? I'm 25 years old, and before deciding to get my degree I spent time in the service
                industry,
                working as a server, bartender, and sales associate. I attended Winter Park HS, was in the IB program,
                and
                recieved my varsity letters for excellence on the swim and rowing teams. I have a goldren retriever, and
                a
                brown/white short-haired white cat. Big on Sci-Fi, card and board games, books, tennis, and sand
                volleyball.</p>
