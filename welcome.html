            <h2>Welcome To RealtyHub!</h2>

            <p class="introLetter">
                The Realty Hub business model, at its core, is a digital brokerage firm. Instead of a firm located in a
                single area, Realty Hub is 100% online which allows our company expand out to different cities
                and states to reach as many agents as possible do business without phisically imposed restrictions. With
                the idea of implementing a complete computerized realty brokerage, it provides faster communication
                between us and our realtors and easier access to all of our resources.
            </p>
            <p class="introLetter">
                Some of the other the advantages of the RealtyHub being digital is that the money saved by not paying
                for phisical office space which lowers our bottom line, savings which we can pass on to you! The digital
                brokerage model allows our company to work with a leaner and more agile model as opposed to the outdated
                physically limited infrastructure other brokerages still work with, while reaching farther among the
                market by being able to contract realtors working in different states in the south-east US. Promoting
                our company purely through technological formats such as the Google Ad you found us through, allows the
                company to be ubiquitous and reach a wider audience while it also saves the expense of doing
                physical advertisements as well.The long and short of it is, by not keeping a physical workspace
                but a digital one to do business with our realty agent, we can offer you a lower taking of the contracts
                we broker with you and your clients to increase your overall commission.
